Pirate Budget Calculator
This is a simple Python program that calculates a weekly budget for meals and pirate bucks based on the total amount of meals and pirate bucks the user has.

The program uses the datetime library to calculate the number of weeks between today's date and May 5, 2022. It then divides the total number of meals and pirate bucks by the number of weeks to get the weekly budget for each.

The program has been updated with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter library. The GUI prompts the user to enter the total number of meals and pirate bucks they have, and displays the weekly budget for meals and pirate bucks.

Requirements
Python 3.x
tkinter library
Usage
Clone the repository or download the source code.
Install the tkinter library if it's not already installed on your system.
Run the program using a Python IDE or from the command line by navigating to the directory where the source code is saved and entering the command: python pirate_budget.py
The GUI will appear, prompting the user to enter the total number of meals and pirate bucks they have.
Click the "Calculate" button to calculate the weekly budget for meals and pirate bucks.
The result will be displayed in the GUI.
